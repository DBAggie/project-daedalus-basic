                <p>What is this website for. Well...I have no idea. I wanted a project to work on and I though this
                    would be an interesting exercise and give me a chance to learn a lot of new things about web
                    development, app development, and back end systems. I have more about my work experience on my about
                    me page if you are interesting in reading. So what is my plan. To the left I have a current list of
                    items I have in the pipeline. I will have my complete source code on Github.

                <p>The goal of this project is to give myself a challenge. Stage 1 will consist of creating two static
                    web pages
                    where I develop each one using a different language or framework. Stage 2 will be to develop
                    enhancements
                    for each static web page depending on the language or frameworks being utilized. I would like to
                    showcase
                    at least one or two unique features of the language or framework. Suggestions are always welcome.
                    Stage 3
                    will involve creating more typical applications using frameworks such as NextJS.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Each website will be
                    accessible to each other and a lot of the content will be copied and adjusted as necessary. This is
                    to
                    allow me to focus more on learning the environment rather than figuring out what I want the site to
                    look
                    like. I hate the front end development of websites. This is an attempt to gain a better
                    understanding of
                    front and back end but, I will do my best to focus on the front end aspect as I know I am weak in
                    that
                    department.

                    </br>
                    My code will all be available and suggestions on this project are welcome. Whether it is for changes
                    to
                    the existing code to make it more inline with common practices or feature enhancements. Wish me luck
                    and
                    enjoy trying to break my site. I am attempting to make everything dynamic so it should resize
                    content to
                    fit the device it is on. If you find an instance where this is not the case please open a ticket on
                    Github.
